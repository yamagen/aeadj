### 🧩 Notes vs Column

- **notes** are for linguistic or grammatical insights (meaning, pragmatics, immediate grammar)
- **column** offers cultural background, anecdotes, or emotional context

## 📌 Example

```json
  {
    "date": "2024.12.03",
    "day": "Tue",
    "number": 240,
    "index": "oniisan",
    "title": "Oniisan",
    "expression-ja": "お(兄:にい)さん",
    "roman-ja": "Oniisan",
    "English": "Big brother",
    "img-sub": "oniisan01.png",
    "example-ja": "お(兄:にい)さん、(手伝:てつだ)ってくれる？",
    "example-en": "Big brother, can you help me?",
    "notes-en": "\"Oniisan\" means \"big brother\" in Japanese. It is used to refer to an older brother or a young man who is older than the speaker even if he is not a brother. It is better not to use it for someone you don't know, you are regarded as a vulgar person. Of course, \"oneesan\" is the same.",
    "notes-ja": "\"お兄さん\"は、日本語で「お兄さん」という意味です。年上の兄弟や、兄弟でなくても年上の男性を指すときに使われます。あまり親しくない間や見ず知らずの人に対して、使うとあなたが下品な人として見做されるので、知らない人には使わない方がよい。もちろん、「お姉さん」も同様です。"
  },
```

> Note: Earlier entries may use "roman" instead of "roman-ja". These will be unified in future revisions.
